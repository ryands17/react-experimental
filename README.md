# React Experimental

> ✨ Bootstrapped with Create Snowpack App (CSA).

## Available Scripts

### yarn start

Runs the app in dev mode.
Open http://localhost:8080 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### yarn test

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about running tests for more information.

### yarn lint

Runs [ESLint](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/) with sane and secure defaults :)

### yarn build

Builds a static copy of your site to the `build/` folder.

**For the best production performance:** Add a build bundler plugin like "@snowpack/plugin-webpack" or "@snowpack/plugin-parcel" to your `snowpack.config.json` config file.
